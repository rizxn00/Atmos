# Atmos: Just Another Weather App
Ah, yes, another weather app! Because the world desperately needs more of those. But hey, at least this one has a cool name: Atmos! It's like "atmosphere," but shorter and hipper 🌨️. 

### What's Special About Atmos?

Absolutely nothing! Atmos is a basic weather app with limited functionality, just like every other weather app on the planet.
